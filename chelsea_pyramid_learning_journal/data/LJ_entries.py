        "body": "Today's pyramid lab was a complete shit show... I'm still at CF right now and we've already had so many back-and-forths between versions in this project that I have no idea where we are. We have done a git hard reset, and a push -f tonight, and things are only still kiiiiiinda working. Plus we're around 2 days behind. I just want to be able to get started and really going on this database, but I feel like I'm just bogged down in this old stuff. \r\n\r\nI'm questioning whether I'm learning anything. I can see I'm getting faster with some things (Python as a language, command line stuff, etc) but I could absolutely NOT replicate anything in Pyramid at this moment, and I can't imagine how I'd be able to even in a few weeks."

        "body": "Today we learned some crazy complicated and confusing shit about Pyramid. Honestly, I was pretty stressed out and confused during lecture because it all felt very over my head. However, heap hasn't been AS mindblowingly hard as i had originally worried, and (though I've been spending all of lab so far -- until 6:30pm -- figuring out yesterdays work) I feel on more solid ground. So... yay? :/"

        "body": "Today we started on Pyramid, and to be honest most of the lecture was very very confusing for me. I'm really not seeing how all the diferent pieces connect right now, thought I hope I'll figure it out eventually. \r\n\r\nThe data structures for today (Deque) was pretty easy though! It was nice to see how what we've learned thusfar is helping us get those faster."

        "body": "End of week two. 1/5 of the way through the course. Even though 20% isn't too much, these two weeks have felt both veeeery slow and very rapid. I feel very solid with Python as a language, and have had some successful (honestly near euphoric) moments, but mostly I'm tired and frustrated and feel unsuccessful in a lot that I do. \r\n\r\nI think I need to get a lot of sleep this weekend, though I need to get at least the Friday Sockets assignment out of the way too."

        "body": "Today was pretty good. We went over mailroom (which I actually cleaned up on my own the other night) and some stack stuff in class, and I spent most of the day just doing lab. \r\n\r\nI stayed pretty late with carson, but I actually don't feel burned out like I sometimes do really late. Not stressful, just determined. \r\n\r\nHonestly though I'm reeeeally not a fan of these data structures we're doing. It all feels so unuseful outside of job interviews. I wish we could spend majority of time on sockets/server stuff."

        "body": "The whiteboarding challenge today was amazing. It was a challenge, and honestly did not expect to be able to do really well in it, but Carson and I surprised ourselves and completed all the challenges. \r\n\r\nI walked away from it feeling really good about linked lists, but honestly that all disappeared in lab... sockets with Kavdi went well, but Carson and I got really bogged down on having to refactor our code and it was very discouraging. We kinda (almost?) finished what we had to do for the day, but we both felt very just DONE. Wish I'd been able to come away from it feeling more successful."

The http request stuff is kind of crazy to me and I'm really reeeeeally sketchy on the exact vocab, but I feel i'm getting more clear about what the underlying functionality is. :)"

Kinley and I mapped it out yesterday and I totally understood what I THOUGHT I had to do, going in. \r\n\r\nHowever, once I'd finished I realized that I had to completely refactor in order to be able to test it, and out of nowhere I became very frustrated and mad at myself, in an unusually emotional way for me. I usually handle stress well, and I can't explain why it hit me more today (when I've been more bogged down/behind with other projects in the past, comparatively) but I basically wanted to scream for two hours straight today"

I like typing out just straight up english, or essentially coding (with only a few comments for \"add shit here!\") â€” but this in between style is strange\r\n\r\nHowever, like I said, solid day :)"

Kinley and I may have mildly overdone the number of tests needed, but we got kind of into edge cases and stuff. Either way, a fun lab! \r\n\r\nHowever, not sure I'll use my newly-acquired twitter"

        "body": "Today was day 1 of 401 Python. I am excited to be going into the course with a greater awareness of our time allotment to different subjects, though (as always) intimidated by the forthcoming amount of coursework. I like Python a lot as a language so far. It's very clear and clean-looking, which is super welcome after the bracket-infested hell of JavaScript\r\n\r\nI do feel mildly disappointed that the learning journals are so public though. It wasn't exactly my diary in 201/301, but I do think the increased access to the class as a whole might make them less of a good rant/decompression platform"
